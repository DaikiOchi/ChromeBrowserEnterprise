# Creating and managing projects
To create a project, you must have the resourcemanager.projects.create permission. This permission is included in roles like the Project Creator role (roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator). 

To create a new project, do the following:

1. Go to the **Manage resources** page in the Google Cloud console. Go to [Manage Resources](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager)
2. On the **Select organization** drop-down list at the top of the page, select the organization resource in which you want to create a project.
3. Click **Create** Project
4. In the New Project window that appears, enter a project name. A project name can contain only letters, numbers, single quotes, hyphens, spaces, or exclamation points, and must be between 4 and 30 characters.
5. Enter the parent organization or folder resource in the **Location** box. That resource will be the hierarchical parent of the new project. If No organization is the only option, you will need to reach out to your company Cloud admin.
6. When you're finished entering new project details, click **Create**.
