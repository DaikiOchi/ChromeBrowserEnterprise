# Create a Google Cloud project
A Google Cloud project is required to use CBCM APIs. This project forms the basis for creating, enabling, and using all Google Cloud services, including managing APIs.

To create a Google Cloud project:

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to **Menu > IAM & Admin > Create a Project**.

> Go to [Create a Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)

2. In the **Project Name** field, enter a descriptive name for your project.
Optional: To edit the **Project ID**, click **Edit**. The project ID can't be changed after the project is created, so choose an ID that meets your needs for the lifetime of the project.

3. In the **Location** field, click **Browse** to display potential locations for your project. Then, click Select.

4. Click **Create**. The console navigates to the Dashboard page, and your project is created within a few minutes.
